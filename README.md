# Python-Test-Repo

A brief description of a new repository containing all test project files, including the revision history of a Python Course.

## Project Goal

This project is under a university course. The main focus is practicing python with a project by sort of real-life examples.

### Course Title

Mainly, the course title is "Scientific programming with Python including applications of machine learning, FAIR data and network programming".



### Course Goals

To know the core concepts of Python from both a data science and industrial programming perspective. We will learn concepts of Python, machine learning, and computer networks through hands-on programming exercises using scientific datasets from synchrotrons and FEL radiation. To acquire the competence to analyze complex data and large data sets from experiments in the field of X-ray and nanotechnology research. To know the concepts of FAIR data and data management and know how this is dealt with in the DAPHNE4NFDI project.

## Content

- Introduction to Python: variables, data types, loops, arrays, functions, Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Manipulation, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

- Machine learning: Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, scikit-learn, tensorflow, SciPy, development and training of neural networks.

- Networks and hardware: network services in Python, TPC/IP protocol, socket programming.

- FAIR data: collection of metadata, electronic logbooks, data repositories, data management plans.

## Demo

```python
try:
    me = mydul()

    while(me.alive()):
        me.happy()

except NameError as x:
    print(x)

else:
    print("A Person called 'Mydul' ")


"""name 'mydul' is not defined"""
```
